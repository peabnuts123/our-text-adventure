# Our Text Adventure - WWW

This is the frontend project for Our Text Adventure. It is a single-page-app / static site generated using [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby). The site is pre-rendered at compile-time from a set of managed content. At runtime, once the site has loaded, React takes over as a single-page-app, and fetches dynamic data from the API.

You can learn more about Gatsby [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com).
